## 2025-05-14 - Initial Accessibility Audit
**Learning:** The app has a strong visual identity but lacks basic accessibility features like ARIA labels for icon-only buttons and clear focus indicators for keyboard navigation.
**Action:** Implement ARIA labels, expanded states, and focus-visible styles to make the premium experience accessible to everyone.

## 2025-05-15 - Quiz Keyboard Navigation and Focus Management
**Learning:** For interactive game-like interfaces (like quizzes), automatic focus management and keyboard shortcuts (1-4, A-D) significantly improve the "premium" feel and accessibility for power users.
**Action:** Always implement focus flow (focus first option, then focus next action) and common keyboard shortcuts when building multi-step interactive components.
