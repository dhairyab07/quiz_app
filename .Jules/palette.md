## 2025-05-14 - Initial Accessibility Audit
**Learning:** The app has a strong visual identity but lacks basic accessibility features like ARIA labels for icon-only buttons and clear focus indicators for keyboard navigation.
**Action:** Implement ARIA labels, expanded states, and focus-visible styles to make the premium experience accessible to everyone.
## 2026-02-17 - Keyboard Shortcuts & ARIA Feedback
**Learning:** For interactive quizzes, providing numeric keyboard shortcuts (1-4) along with visual hints significantly reduces cognitive load and improves accessibility. Combining these with aria-live announcements for results ensures a cohesive experience for all users.
**Action:** Always include keyboard shortcuts and associated ARIA live regions for high-interaction quiz or form components.
