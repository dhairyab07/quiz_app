## 2025-05-14 - Initial Accessibility Audit
**Learning:** The app has a strong visual identity but lacks basic accessibility features like ARIA labels for icon-only buttons and clear focus indicators for keyboard navigation.
**Action:** Implement ARIA labels, expanded states, and focus-visible styles to make the premium experience accessible to everyone.

**Action:** Always pair visual shortcut hints with ARIA announcements to ensure both sighted and screen-reader users benefit from the speed of keyboard navigation.
