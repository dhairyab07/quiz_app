## 2025-05-14 - Initial Accessibility Audit
**Learning:** The app has a strong visual identity but lacks basic accessibility features like ARIA labels for icon-only buttons and clear focus indicators for keyboard navigation.
**Action:** Implement ARIA labels, expanded states, and focus-visible styles to make the premium experience accessible to everyone.

**Learning:** Adding screen reader announcements and keyboard shortcuts transforms a purely visual "premium" experience into an inclusive one without compromising the aesthetic.
**Action:** Always include an invisible aria-live region (announcer) and basic keyboard shortcuts (Enter, 1-4) for interactive components like quizzes.
