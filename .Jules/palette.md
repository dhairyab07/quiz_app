## 2025-05-14 - Initial Accessibility Audit
**Learning:** The app has a strong visual identity but lacks basic accessibility features like ARIA labels for icon-only buttons and clear focus indicators for keyboard navigation.
**Action:** Implement ARIA labels, expanded states, and focus-visible styles to make the premium experience accessible to everyone.

## 2026-02-18 - Keyboard Shortcuts and Screen Reader Feedback
**Learning:** Adding keyboard shortcuts (1-4, Enter) combined with visual hints and an `aria-live` announcer creates a powerful "pro" experience that is also fully accessible to screen reader users.
**Action:** Always pair keyboard shortcuts with visual hints and dynamic screen reader announcements to ensure they are discoverable and usable by all.
